local newBrick = Instance.new("Part", workplace)
-- change the color by tping this
newBrick.BrickColor = "Really Red" -- any color you want here
-- change the transparency by typing someting like this
newBrick.Transparency = 0.5 -- whatever transparency you want
-- if you want to make go in the sky and drop down type this
newBrick.Position = Vector3.new(0, 30, 0) -- the first is x second is y (the part that decides wheter or not its 50 units up in the air or 50 units down and lastly the third is z)
